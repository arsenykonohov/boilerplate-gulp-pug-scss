# Build (A. Konohov) #


***
#### Piece of advice:

+ Start your installation from [_source](./_source/), and run project from there 
+ If you use gh-pages, look at [index](./index/)
+ Put features from customer to [_material](./_material/)
+ gh-pages as default branch (for preview)


***
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
$ gulp c (clean all productions)

```

#### what inside:

* PUG - preprocessor

* SCSS - preprocessor (pretty SASS)

* BEM (just naming)

* COMPONENT flow (source structure)

* browserSync

## ENJOY!
